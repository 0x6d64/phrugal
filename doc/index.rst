phrugal documentation
=====================

Welcome to the documentation of phrugal, a tool that helps you printing out your pictures.
This is an example output when given a set of input images:

.. image:: ./img/example-out.jpg

For a basic description on how to run the tool, see the chapter :ref:`usage`.
If you want to create your own configuration (e.g. to define the text on the image
border), see the chapter :ref:`configuration`.
